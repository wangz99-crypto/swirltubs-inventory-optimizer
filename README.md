# Service Van Inventory Optimization Tool

A decision support tool that recommends an optimal set of spare parts to stock in service vans under storage capacity constraints in order to maximize total annual net savings.

---

## Business Problem

Swirltubs manages a large network of field technicians who perform on-site service calls.

Each technician stocks spare parts in their service van to complete repairs during the first visit. However:

- Stocking **more parts** increases inventory holding costs
- Stocking **fewer parts** increases revisit costs when repairs cannot be completed immediately
- Each service van has a **limited storage capacity**

The challenge is to determine:

> **Which combination of spare parts should be stocked to minimize overall service costs and maximize net savings?**

---

## Decision Objective

This tool formulates the stocking decision as a constrained optimization problem:

Maximize:

Total Net Savings = Revisit Cost Avoided − Inventory Holding Cost

Subject to:

Total Storage Used ≤ Available Van Capacity


---

## Optimization Approach

The recommended stocking plan is generated by solving an optimization model that evaluates all feasible combinations of parts within the available van storage capacity and selects the mix that maximizes expected annual net savings.

This ensures that the final recommendation is **globally optimal** given the specified cost assumptions and capacity constraints.

The decision model considers:

- Annual demand for each part
- Inventory holding cost (assumed as 25% of part cost annually)
- Revisit cost incurred when a part is not stocked
- Storage space required by each part

---

## Demand Uncertainty Simulation

Annual part usage can vary from year to year.

To evaluate how the recommended plan performs under demand uncertainty, the tool simulates multiple demand scenarios around historical usage levels and tracks changes in:

- Total service cost
- Fix-it-first rate (first-visit completion)
- Net savings

This allows decision makers to assess how robust the stocking plan is under fluctuating service demand.
